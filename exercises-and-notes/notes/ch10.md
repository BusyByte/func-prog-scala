# Monoids

first introduction to `purely algebraic structures`

useful in 2 ways:
- they facilitate parallel computation by giving us the freedom to break our problem into chunks that can be computed in parallel
- they can be composed to assemble complex calculations from simpler pieces

## 10.1 What is a monoid?

`identity element`

`associative` ((r + s) + t) or (r + (s + t)) doesn't matter

same rules as addition

&& and || operations are also associative and have an identity (true and false)

laws of associativity and identity are collectively called the monoid laws

`type A is monoidal`

## 10.2 Folding lists with monoids

foldLeft or foldRight when folding ith a monoid;
 we should get the same result

## 10.3 Associativity and parallelism

reduce a list using a `balanced fold`
