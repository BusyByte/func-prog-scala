# Applicative and traversable functors

## Generalizing monads

 a different abstraction by letting `unit` and `map2` be the primitives
 
 `applicative functor` - less powerful but provides benefits
 
 ## 12.2 The Applicative trait
 
 `all applicatives are functors`
 
 map2 and unit
 
 or
 
 unit and apply
 
 implement map2 in terms of flatMap
 
 `all monads are applicative functors`
 
 don't need separate `Applicative` instance for Monads
 
 ## 12.3 The difference between monads and applicative functors
 
 join `F[F[A]]` => `F[A]`
 
 ### 12.3.1 The Option applicative verses the Option monad
 
 `the result of one lookup to affect what lookup we do next` then flatMap or join
 
 applicative - the computation is fixed
 
 monad previous computations may influence what computations run next
 
 `"Effects" in FP`
 
 call type constructors like Par, Option, List, Parser, Gen, ... etc `effects`
 
 augment ordinary capabilities with `extra` capabilities
 
 ### 12.3.2 The Parser applicative verses the Parser monad
 
 applicative - context free computation
 
 monad - context sensitive 
 
 ## 12.4 The advantages of applicative functors
 
 traverse combinator
 
 interpreter of applicative effects more flexibility
 
 applicative functors compose, monads don't
 
 ### 12.4.1 Not all applicative functors are monads
 
 Streams map and zip
 
 monad validName fails then validBirthdate and validPhone wonâ€™t even run
 
 map3 no dependency between 3 expressions
 
 ## 12.5 The applicative laws
 
 ### 12.5.1 Left and right identity
 
 ```
map(v)(id) == v
map(map(v)(g))(f) == map(v)(f compose g)
```

### 12.5.2 Associativity

```
op(a, op(b, c)) == op(op(a, b), c)
compose(f, op(g, h)) == compose(compose(f, g), h)
```

using combinators product and assoc:

```
product(product(fa,fb),fc) == map(product(fa, product(fb,fc)))(assoc)
```

 ### 12.5.3 Naturality of product
 
 naturality
 
 we generally have the option of applying transformations before or after combining values with map2
 
 `map2(a,b)(productF(f,g)) == product(map(a)(f), map(b)(g))`
 
 
 ## 12.6 Traversable functors
 
 abstract over type constructor
 
 ## 12.7 Uses of Traverse
 
 ### 12.7.1 From monoids to applicative functors
