# Effects and I/O

`effectful programs`

# External Effects and I/O

`external effects`

I/O monad

distinction between `effects` and `side effects`

I/O monad embedding imperative programming with I/O effects in pure program 
while preserving referential transparency

separate `effectful` code - code needs effect on outside world - from rest of program

`description` of an effectful computation, separate `interpreter` that preforms effects

embedded domain-specific language (EDSL)

## 13.1 Factoring effects

two responsibilities - computing, and printing

still computing message

computing, create display message, printing all separate

side effect 'println' in `outermost` layer

inside println is a `pure expression`

`inside every function with side effects is a pure function waiting to get out`

impure function f of type A => B

split into:
 - a pure function of type A => D where D is some `description` of result of f
 - an impure function of type D => B where though of as an `interpreter` of these descriptions
 
## 13.2 A simple IO type

```scala
trait IO { def run: Unit }

def PrintLine(msg: String): IO = new IO { def run = println(msg) }

def contest(p1: Player, p2: Player): IO = PrintLine(winnerMsg(winner(p1, p2)))
```

contest has or produces an `effect` or `effectful`

interpreter of the IO actually has the `side` effect when run is called

responsibility of `interpreting` effect and actually manipulating the console is held by `run` 
method in IO

IO is a Monoid (empty for identity and ++ for associativity)

`List[IO]` can be reduced to just IO

you define API

at its core is `language design`

craft little language and associated interpreter

### 13.2.1 Handling Input effects

add type parameter to IO as `sealed trait IO[A]`

now can return Unit as A or String as A

### 13.2.2 Benefits and drawbacks of the simple IO type

`clearly separates pure  code from impure code`

can StackOverflowError with the simple one

opaque

can't handle concurrency or asynchronous ops

## 13.3 Avoiding the StackOverflowError
