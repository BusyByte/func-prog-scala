# Parser combinators

`algebraic design`

## 9.1 Designing an algebra, first

`algebra` - a collection of functions operating over some data type(s), along with a set of laws specifying relationships between these functions

`algebraic design` - start with the algebra (including its laws) and decide on a representation later

## 9.2 A possible algebra

`structure preserving`

### 9.2.1 Slicing and nonempty repetition

Exercise 9.5 It seems like overkill to introduce something like Par/Future/Task or actors

## 9.3 Handling context sensitivity

## 9.4 Writing a JSON parser

### 9.4.1 The JSON format

### 9.4.2 A JSON parser

## 9.5 Error Reporting

### 9.5.1 A possible design

### 9.5.2 Error nesting   

### 9.5.3 Controlling branching and backtracking
