# What is functional programming?

pure functions - functions without side effects

something other than return a result

examples of side effects
- Modifying a variable
- Modifying a data structure in place
- Setting a field on an object
- Throwing an exception or halting with an error ï‚¡ Printing to the console or reading user input
- Reading from or writing to a file
- Drawing on the screen

restriction on `how` we write programs
not `what` we can express
